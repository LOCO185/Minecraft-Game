a 2d look A like minecraft , built as a weekend project in Fullstack course.

how to play:
- press start
- start crafting with the specific tool , and build your own place.

things I learned in this project :
- creating HTML through JavaScript vanilla commands.
- manipulate the DOM.
- use pseudo code.
- creating 2X2 matrix using two for loops.
- media responsive for mobiles (Tilted Screen and regular).
